## Universal web proxy based on node unblocker
## GFW has started to interfere with herokuapp.com's SSL, causing sometimes network instability
This project is a copy of [node-unblocker] (https://github.com/nfriedly/node-unblocker), but the project structure has been modified so that it can be deployed directly on Heroku; in the original author's version, all agents The request is sent to http. In this scenario, the URL containing the sensitive domain name will cause the connection to be reset by the GFW. Therefore, in this copy, the code was modified to allow all proxy requests to use https.

Try it online: https://banned-sites007.herokuapp.com/

Node-unblocker performs better than PHP's web proxy and is easy to deploy on Heroku. Heroku offers a free account and does not require a credit card to be attached for easy deployment. If you are concerned that using a server provided by someone else may reveal personal privacy, you can set up your own web proxy with one-click deployment. Deploy your own agents, decentralized, and small-scale use is less likely to be blocked by GFW.

If you find this project useful, please recommend it to your friends and relatives and let more people benefit.

For one-click deployment, please click the "Deploy to Heroku" button below. For details, please refer to [WIKI] (https://github.com/gfw-breaker/heroku-node-proxy/wiki).

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Note: This proxy is available for most websites but cannot play YouTube videos. To watch a YouTube video, please use [you2php-heroku](https://github.com/gfw-breaker/you2php-heroku#--end--).
